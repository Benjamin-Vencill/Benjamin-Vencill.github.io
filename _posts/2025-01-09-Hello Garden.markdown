# Hello Garden!

In this short post, I talk about some of the things I've been working on in this space. First, I got started with Jekyll and learned how to host a Jekyll powered site using GitHub Pages. That's where we are now. You can check out my [Welcome to Jekyll](https://benjamin-vencill.github.io/jekyll/update/2025/01/10/Welcome-to-Jekyll.html) post to see what the defaults look like.

Second, I build a quick little parser to replace backlinks in my blog posts with the correct links to the page. Was this worth it? Maybe, who knows. I don't know the full capabilities of Jekyll but it seems simplistic and meant for words-on-a-page and not quite the dynamic site I'm hoping to eventually host content on, so who knows if I'll keep this around or not. But this is a good start and the principle of [[Just Get Started]] is very much at play.
